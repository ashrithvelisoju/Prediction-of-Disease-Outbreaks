# Disease Prediction System üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

An intelligent healthcare application that leverages machine learning models and Google's Generative AI to predict three major diseases (Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease) and provides personalized AI-powered medical recommendations.

## Overview

The Disease Prediction System is a comprehensive Streamlit-based web application that combines pre-trained machine learning models with Google's Gemini AI to provide accurate disease predictions and personalized healthcare suggestions. The system acts as a virtual health consultant, analyzing patient parameters and offering expert-level medical guidance for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease management.

## Key Features

### üî¨ Multi-Disease Prediction
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Using 8 clinical parameters including glucose levels, BMI, and family history
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Analyzing 13 cardiovascular parameters including cholesterol, blood pressure, and ECG results
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction**: Evaluating 22 voice and speech parameters for neurological assessment

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Medical Recommendations
- **Expert-Level Consultations**: AI acts as specialist doctors (diabetologist, cardiologist, neurologist)
- **Personalized Diet Plans**: Custom nutrition recommendations based on patient parameters
- **Treatment Suggestions**: Evidence-based treatment options and medication guidance
